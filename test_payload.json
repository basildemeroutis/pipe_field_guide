    "long_bldg_descr": "123 Main Street is a seven-storey plus basement commercial office building constructed in 1985 with steel frame and reinforced concrete floors. The building presents a Portland stone and glazed curtain wall facade typical of mid-1980s West End commercial architecture. Typical floor plates of approximately 9,100 sq ft NIA with central core providing two 13-person passenger lifts and single goods lift. The 2018 refurbishment modernised common areas and introduced raised access floors throughout. Ground floor comprises reception and retail unit fronting Main Street.",

    "long_bldg_system_summary": "The building is served by a variable refrigerant flow (VRF) system installed during the 2018 refurbishment, with roof-mounted condensing units serving floor-by-floor fan coil units. Heating is provided via the same VRF system operating in heat pump mode, supplemented by LTHW radiators in common areas fed from a gas-fired boiler in the basement plant room. Ventilation is mechanical with heat recovery, achieving approximately 12 l/s/person. Lighting is LED throughout with PIR occupancy sensors and daylight dimming. The Trend IQ4 BMS provides centralised monitoring and control of all major systems.",

    "planning_history": "The building has an active planning history reflecting ongoing improvement works. Most recently, full planning permission (ref 23/04521/FULL) was granted in October 2023 for air source heat pump installation. In 2018, approval was granted for the comprehensive refurbishment including new shopfront and entrance canopy (ref 17/09876/FULL). A 2015 application for a two-storey rooftop extension was refused due to impact on conservation area views (ref 15/02345/FULL). Listed Building Consent is not required as the building is not listed.",

    "crrem_comments": "Based on current EUI of 198 kWh/m²/year and building emission rate of 52.3 kgCO₂/m²/year, the building intersects the CRREM 1.5°C pathway for UK offices in 2029. This represents a stranding risk within 4 years under current performance. The standing point analysis indicates the building is currently 187 kgCO₂/m² above the cumulative carbon budget to 2050. Key assumptions include: grid decarbonisation per National Grid FES 2024, no major interventions, and stable occupancy patterns.",
    "crrem_adv_comments": "The advanced CRREM analysis models three intervention scenarios against the 1.5°C pathway. Scenario 1 (fabric-first) extends stranding to 2034 through improved insulation and glazing (£2.1m capex). Scenario 2 (electrification) achieves pathway compliance through ASHP installation and renewable procurement (£3.8m capex, payback 8.2 years). Scenario 3 (deep retrofit) combines both approaches with PV installation, achieving a 65% EUI reduction and creating 12-year carbon budget headroom (£6.2m capex). NPV analysis favours Scenario 2 at current energy prices. Confidence is moderate given uncertainty in future grid carbon factors and occupier energy consumption patterns.",

    "cert_target_EPC": "B",
    "cert_target_EPC_comments": "Achieving EPC B (sub-50) is realistic through the proposed retrofit interventions. The primary drivers are electrification of heating (removing gas dependency), improved building fabric performance, and on-site renewable generation. Modelling indicates an achievable rating of B (42) post-intervention. High confidence in lighting and controls improvements; moderate confidence in fabric measures due to conservation area constraints on external insulation. The 2028 MEES threshold of EPC B makes this a compliance requirement for continued letting.",
    "cert_target_breeam": "EXCELLENT",
    "cert_target_breeam_comments": "BREEAM In-Use Excellent certification is achievable with targeted investment. Current assessment indicates strong performance in Management (exemplary BMS and maintenance regime) and Health & Wellbeing (good daylight and air quality). Weaker areas include Energy (high EUI), Materials (limited information on 2018 refurbishment materials), and Land Use & Ecology (minimal greening). Key actions required: renewable energy procurement, biodiversity improvements to roof terrace, and enhanced waste management. Estimated certification cost £45,000 including assessor fees.",
    "cert_target_nabers": "4.0",
    "cert_target_nabers_comments": "NABERS UK Energy rating of 4.0 stars is a realistic near-term target, with 5.0 stars achievable post-deep retrofit. Current performance would achieve approximately 2.5 stars based on 198 kWh/m²/year EUI. The gap to 4.0 stars (approximately 90 kWh/m²/year) requires significant intervention. Quick wins include optimising BMS schedules (estimated 15% reduction), LED lighting completion, and tenant engagement programme. Deep retrofit measures (ASHP, enhanced insulation) required for 5.0 star performance.",
    "cert_target_well": "Gold",
    "cert_target_well_comments": "WELL v2 Gold certification is achievable through targeted improvements building on existing strengths. The 2018 refurbishment provides good baseline air quality and thermal comfort. Strong performance expected in Air (mechanical ventilation with heat recovery), Light (LED with daylight dimming), and Movement (cycle storage and showers). Gaps exist in Nourishment (no on-site catering facilities), Mind (limited biophilic design), and Community (meeting space constraints). Recommended: biophilic design package for reception and common areas, enhanced water filtration, and acoustic improvements to open plan floors.",

    "renew_struct": "Structural assessment indicates roof can accommodate 15 kWp PV array without reinforcement. Additional loading for larger installation requires further structural survey.",
    "renew_conclusions": "Solar PV installation is technically viable with 420 m² of useable roof area supporting approximately 63 kWp capacity. Estimated annual generation of 53,550 kWh would offset approximately 7% of current building consumption. Combined with approved ASHP installation, renewable energy contribution increases significantly. Key constraint is roof access for maintenance given existing plant. Confidence in structural assessment is moderate pending detailed survey. Recommend proceeding with planning application for PV installation concurrent with ASHP works.",

    "strategic_decarb_comments": "The optimised Retrofit Strategy achieves a 57% reduction in EUI from 198 to 85 kWh/m²/year through a phased approach. Phase 1 (2026) focuses on quick wins: BMS optimisation, completion of LED retrofit, and tenant engagement programme delivering 20% reduction at minimal cost. Phase 2 (2027) delivers electrification: ASHP installation replacing gas boilers (planning approved), VRF system optimisation, and renewable energy procurement. Phase 3 (2028) addresses fabric: secondary glazing to all office floors, roof insulation upgrade, and PV installation. Interventions discounted include external wall insulation (conservation area constraints) and full window replacement (cost-benefit unfavourable). The strategy achieves MEES compliance, CRREM pathway alignment to 2040, and positions the asset for NABERS 4.0 star rating. Embodied carbon of 245 kgCO₂/m² is within LETI guidance for major refurbishment. Confidence is high for Phase 1-2 measures; moderate for Phase 3 pending detailed design.",

The largest cost drivers are main plant replacement (ASHP and associated electrical upgrade) at 18% of total, and reception/common area upgrades at 14%. Professional fees at 15% of construction cost is conservative given project complexity. Key cost risks include: discovery works to existing structure (10% contingency included), energy price volatility affecting payback calculations, and potential conservation officer requirements.
